///         $YOLO for 1 to 52 weeks. The lock's power = amount x term in weeks / 52 is fixed when the lock is set and
///         does not change until its end unless the lock is changed: setting a term again (extending) recomputes it
///         from the whole amount and the weeks actually left, `amount x weeks left / 52`; adding without a new term
///         adds `added x weeks left / 52` to the power. The bonus itself is not computed here:
///         the CaseDesk reads `powerAt` at a submission and compares it with the task's whole reward at the submission
///         in $YOLO plus the task's $YOLO add-on (4% x min(1, power / (reward + add-on))); the DisputeDesk checks `stakePower` at the payout (the same lock still running, never withdrawn
///         in between: a lock's `epoch` grows at every withdrawal). This contract pays nothing itself.
///
///         `lock(add, weeks)` adds to the amount and/or sets the end to `weeks` from now (1..52); the end cannot move
///         earlier, the amount only grow; a lock that ended may be locked again. `withdraw` takes the whole amount once
///         the lock ended. Every change is checkpointed, so the power at any past moment can be read back. No owner,
