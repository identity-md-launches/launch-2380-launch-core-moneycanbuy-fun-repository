///         CaseDesk (submissions, the state machine, swarm questions), DisputeDesk (disputes, votes, appeals,

///
///         Money rules
///         - Every amount held belongs to exactly one bucket: a task pot, a submission's bonds,
///           check or appeal prepayments, a settlement bucket waiting for lazy claims, a treasury
///           pot, or a user credit. `liabilities[token]` is their sum and changes only when money enters or leaves.
///           Invariant: token balance >= liabilities[token]. Nothing is paid from the "general balance". All payouts
///           are pull (claims, `withdraw`). Only this contract moves money; the desks tell it what to book.
///         - Rewards are locked until the deadline: nobody who put money into a task takes it
///           back before the task expired or was unwound; a top-up during a check joins the reward at once.
///         - Burning: $YOLO the treasury would get goes to the BuybackBurner and sits there until anyone presses
///           "Burn". ETH, USDC and IMD burn shares go straight to the buyback wallet in the same transaction as the
///           payout; if that transfer reverts (a wallet
///           with no `receive`), the payout itself must not fail — that share lands in the BuybackBurner instead,
///           for its own `forward` to retry later.
///         - The vault has no owner. The ParamsRegistry owner (the project wallet) can only change parameters for
///           future tasks and the attester set (48h timelock) and pause task creation. The dev wallet (owner of the
